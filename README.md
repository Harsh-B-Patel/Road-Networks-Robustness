# Road-Networks-Robustness

Abstract
With increasing population, traffic congestion has become a common problem in modern society, especially in developing countries.
Traffic congestion negatively impacts people’s work efficiency and
social development. According to a report, nine out of the twelve
Canadian cities studied, experienced more traffic congestion in 2019
than they did in 2018 [2]. Conditions worsen at rush hour, drivers
with a 30-minute commute each way will spend an extra 17 minutes
in the morning and an extra 21 minutes in the afternoon on the road
[2]. Thus, road construction and design is highly comprehensive
and complex work.
Our goal is to propose a smart traffic application for road construction based on the city map networks. It can evaluate the city
roads to determine if an alternate route exists during the traffic jam
for emergency vehicles or if a better road infrastructure is needed
for some existing road. Our application can help improve the quality of city roads. The application can be used by city planners or
emergency vehicle drivers.
This paper includes discussion regarding details of the models,
algorithms and actual results through our experiments, as well as
analysis of our experiment and further work directions.
